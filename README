This is a Mediawiki template that uses responsive design to make sure the design works across all device types.

Frustrated with the lack of good designs for Mediawiki templates, we set off to design our own.

We eat our own dog food and use this template for our own internal wiki.

To install, drop the folder and two files into the /skins/ directory in mediawiki.
